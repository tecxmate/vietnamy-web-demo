# Dictionary Tab (Vocab Library) - Feature Mockup

**Status:** Mockup / Proposal
**Date:** February 2026

---

## Overview

Redesign the Dictionary tab from a pure search tool into a combined **Dictionary + Vocab Library**. The tab gets two sub-views via a top toggle: **Search** (existing dictionary) and **My Decks** (new vocab library with flashcard testing).

The Vocabulary module currently lives in Practice tab — this moves and integrates it into Dictionary, making Dictionary the single hub for all word-related activity.

## Navigation Structure

```

  |-- [Search]  [My Decks]    <-- sub-tab toggle at top
  |
  |-- Search view (existing dictionary, + bookmark button)

### 6. Flashcard Test - Card (revealed)

### 7. Score Screen

```
+------------------------------------------+
|  [<  Done]                                |
+------------------------------------------+
|                                           |
|              +--------+                   |
|              |   75   |                   |
|              |  /100  |                   |
|              +--------+                   |
|                                           |
|            Great job!                     |
|                                           |
|    [check] 6 Known    [X] 2 Don't know   |
|                                           |
|    +----------------------------------+   |
|    |  Retry: Practice (2) again       |   |
|    +----------------------------------+   |
|                                           |

|                                           |
+------------------------------------------+
```

- Score is out of 100 (percentage)
- "Retry" button only shows if there are "Don't know" words
- Retry runs a mini flashcard session with only the missed words

---

## Data Flow

### Storage (localStorage)

| Key | Data |
|-----|------|
| `vnme_saved_words` | `[{ id, vietnamese, english, ipa }]` — bookmarked from dictionary |
| `vnme_vocab_decks` | `[{ id, name, words: [{id, vietnamese, english, image, emoji, example}] }]` — custom decks |

### Pre-saved Decks

Generated at runtime from existing `vocabWords.js` data, grouped by `CATEGORIES`. These are read-only — users cannot add/remove words from pre-saved decks.

### Word Saving Flow

```
Dictionary Search -> find "pho" -> tap [bookmark]
    -> word saved to `vnme_saved_words`
    -> appears in "Saved Words" deck under My Decks
    -> can be studied with flashcards
```

---

## Component Structure

```
DictionaryTab (main)
  |-- Sub-tab toggle: [Search] [My Decks]
  |
  |-- DictionarySearch (existing search + bookmark button)
  |
  |-- MyDecks
  |     |-- Deck cards (saved, pre-saved, custom)
  |     |-- Create deck modal
  |
  |-- DeckDetail (word list, add/remove)
  |
  |-- FlashcardTest (full-screen study mode)
        |-- Card with tap-to-reveal
        |-- Swipe left/right or button tap
        |-- Score screen with /100
        |-- Retry missed words
```

---

## Design Notes

- Follows existing dark theme with `--primary-color: #FFD166`, `--surface-color: #1E1E1E`
- 3D button press effects on Study/Know/Don't Know buttons
- Cards use same border-radius and shadow as existing source-section cards
- Flashcard has subtle swipe animation (translateX + opacity fade)
- Score circle uses primary color gradient
- Pre-saved deck icons use `BookOpen`, custom use `Layers`, saved use `BookmarkCheck`
- Images from Unsplash (already in vocabWords.js), fallback to emoji

---

## Migration from Practice Tab

The Vocabulary module (`/practice/vocab`) currently has:

- Browse tab (word list by category)
- Flashcard tab (flip cards with arrow nav)
- Quiz tab (multiple choice)
- Review tab (SRS-based review)

**Plan:** Keep the Practice route working for now (no breaking change), but the Dictionary tab becomes the primary home for vocab. The Practice tab's Vocab card can link to Dictionary > My Decks instead.

---

## Open Questions

1. Should flashcard test award Dong currency like the quiz does?
2. Should we fetch online images for custom words (e.g. Unsplash API)?
3. Should saved words sync across devices (requires backend) or stay localStorage only for now?
